# Change Local Workflow

When the user wants to change Trellis phases, next-action hints, whether to create tasks, whether to use sub-agents, or when to check/wrap up, edit `.trellis/workflow.md` first.

## Read These Files First

1. `.trellis/workflow.md`
2. Entry files for the current platform, such as skills/commands/prompts/workflows
3. The current task's `task.json` and `prd.md`

## Common Needs And Edit Points

| Need | Edit point |
| --- | --- |
| Change phase names or phase order | `Phase Index` and the corresponding Phase sections. |
| Change whether to create a task when there is no task | `[workflow-state:no_task]` state block. |
| Change the next step during planning | Phase 1 and `[workflow-state:planning]`. |
| Change whether an agent is required during in_progress | Phase 2 and `[workflow-state:in_progress]`. |
| Change wrap-up after completion | Phase 3 and `[workflow-state:completed]`. |
| Change which skill a user intent triggers | `Skill Routing` table. |

## Modification Steps

1. Find the relevant section in `.trellis/workflow.md`.
2. When changing rules, keep explicit trigger conditions and next actions.
3. If adding or renaming a skill/agent, synchronize the corresponding files in platform directories.
4. Workflow-state changes only need an edit to the `[workflow-state:STATUS]` block in `.trellis/workflow.md`. The hook is parser-only — it reads whatever you put in the block. Keep the opening and closing tags' STATUS strings identical (`[workflow-state:foo]…[/workflow-state:foo]`); mismatched STATUS pairs are silently dropped.
5. Make the AI reread `.trellis/workflow.md`; do not keep using rules from the old conversation.

## Example: Relax Task Creation Requirements

To change when task creation can be skipped, usually edit `[workflow-state:no_task]`:

```md
[workflow-state:no_task]
Task is not required when the answer is a one-reply explanation, no files are changed, and no research is needed.
[/workflow-state:no_task]
```

If the formal Phase 1 flow also needs to change, synchronize the Phase 1 section.

## Example: One Platform Does Not Use Sub-Agents

If the user wants only one platform to avoid sub-agents, first confirm whether that platform has a separate group in the workflow. Then change Phase 2 routing for that platform group instead of deleting all `trellis-implement` / `trellis-check` instructions across platforms.

## `/trellis:continue` Route Table

`/trellis:continue` resumes a task by deciding which phase step to load next. The decision combines `task.json.status` with the presence of artifacts inside the task directory. The mapping is fixed in the command itself; forks that add custom statuses must extend both the workflow.md tag block and this table.

| `status` | Artifact state | Resume at |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `planning` | `prd.md` missing | Phase 1.1 (load `trellis-brainstorm`) |
| `planning` | any new task missing `design.md` or `implement.md` | complete missing planning artifacts |
| `planning` | all three concise planning files are complete | attest → validate → show version → obtain confirmation → version-specific start |
| `in_progress` | no implementation in conversation history | Phase 2.1 (`trellis-implement`) |
| `in_progress` | implementation done, no `trellis-check` run | Phase 2.2 (`trellis-check`) |
| `in_progress` | check passed | Phase 3.3 (spec update) → 3.4 (commit) |
| `completed` | task is still in active tree | Phase 3.5 (run `/trellis:finish-work` to archive) |

When you add a custom status (e.g. `in-review`), add a `[workflow-state:in-review]` block in `.trellis/workflow.md` for the per-turn breadcrumb AND extend this route table — usually by editing the `/trellis:continue` command file (`.{platform}/commands/trellis/continue.md` or equivalent) to add a row that decides where to resume from. Without the route entry, `/trellis:continue` will fall through to a default branch and the user will not land on the step you intended.

## Notes

`.trellis/workflow.md` is the local project workflow, not an immutable template. The user can adapt it to team habits. After editing it, platform entry files may still contain old descriptions, so inspect them too.

## Reviewed planning version and material changes

For every new task, prepare readable, nonempty `prd.md` (requirements), `design.md` (solution), and `implement.md` (implementation and verification order). Keep each concise; the topics above are guidance, not required headings or word counts. Read all three together and resolve contradictions. File presence or a successful script cannot assess meaning or prove user identity.

Before first start or start after replanning:

1. Check the three files and decision-relevant research, then run `task.py attest <task-dir> --note "what was reviewed"`.
2. Run `task.py validate <task-dir>`. A waiting version may validate successfully but is still not approved.
3. Show the user the complete `reviewId`, explanation, and a plain-language summary of scope, solution, verification and limits. Append the summary, original three fingerprints, changes and real response/source to `<task-dir>/research/planning-review-log.md`; do not overwrite older rounds or invent message identifiers. Preserve the old review log before clearing records with replan; if saving fails, address that first. Full historical text requires version control; fingerprints cannot restore overwritten text.
4. Only after the user's explicit response to that version, recheck and run `task.py start <task-dir> --review <reviewId> --approval-note "actual response" --approval-source "locatable conversation source"`. Ordinary attest always creates a new version and clears prior approval; recomputing hashes cannot grant permission.

If requirements, design or the implementation plan materially change, including a change agreed in conversation, pause affected work and dispatched dependencies. Run `task.py replan <task-dir> --reason "what changed" --affected "work to pause" --independent "work that does not depend on the change, or none"`, update the three files and repeat review/confirmation. State why any continuing work is independent; that field does not grant new authorization. Keep normal coding, testing and fixes within the approved requirements moving. Record normal progress separately without checking off the frozen reviewed plan.

For a verified wording-only correction after start, use `task.py attest <task-dir> --editorial --note "specific correction; behavior and scope unchanged"`; preserve the reviewed version and confirmation. If the user has already responded but first start is not recorded, add `--editorial-note "specific correction"` to that same version-specific start. Inspect the actual diff; neither command can determine whether a purported wording correction changes meaning.

Only `in_progress`/`review` tasks with all three planning metadata keys absent may resume through the legacy path without backfilling the files. Partial, null or malformed records are not legacy. Completed tasks cannot start again. Same-task writes are serialized by the main session; concurrency and exactly-once hooks are not promised. Session hints query `task.py planning-status <task-dir> --json`; unavailable checks never imply permission to start. New records must match the current files on resume. Archive planning problems warn while existing archive checks remain in force.
