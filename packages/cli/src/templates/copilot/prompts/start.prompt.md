# Start Session

Initialize a Trellis-managed development session. This platform has no session-start hook, so manually load the equivalent context by following these steps (each one mirrors a section the hook would otherwise inject).

---

## Step 1: Current state
Identity, git status, current task, active tasks, journal location.

```bash
{{PYTHON_CMD}} ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py
```

If this output includes a line beginning `Trellis update available:`, copy the full line verbatim when summarizing session context. Do not shorten operational command hints.

## Step 2: Workflow overview
Phase Index + skill routing table + DO-NOT-skip rules.

```bash
{{PYTHON_CMD}} ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode phase
```

Full guide in `.trellis/workflow.md` (read on demand).

## Step 3: Guideline indexes
Discover packages + spec layers, then read each relevant index file.

```bash
{{PYTHON_CMD}} ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode packages
cat .trellis/spec/guides/index.md
cat .trellis/spec/<package>/<layer>/index.md   # for each relevant layer
```

Index files list the specific guideline docs to read when you actually start coding.

## Step 4: Decide next action
From Step 1 you know the current task and status. Check the task directory:

- **Active task status `planning` + no `prd.md`** → Phase 1.1. Load the `trellis-brainstorm` skill.
- **Active task status `planning` + `prd.md` exists** → stay in Phase 1. Every new task needs concise `prd.md`, `design.md`, and `implement.md`. Load the relevant Phase 1 step detail before `task.py start`.
- **Active task status `in_progress`** → Phase 2 step 2.1. Load the step detail:
  ```bash
  {{PYTHON_CMD}} ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode phase --step 2.1 --platform {{CLI_FLAG}}
  ```
- **No active task** → classify first. For simple conversation / small task, ask only whether this turn should create a Trellis task. For complex work, ask whether you may create a Trellis task and enter planning. If the user says no, skip Trellis for this session.

## Skill routing (quick reference)

| User intent | Skill |
|---|---|
| New feature / unclear requirements | `trellis-brainstorm` |
| About to write code | `trellis-before-dev` |
| Done coding / quality check | `trellis-check` |
| Stuck / fixed same bug multiple times | `trellis-break-loop` |
| Learned something worth capturing | `trellis-update-spec` |

Full rules + anti-rationalization table in `.trellis/workflow.md`.


## Reviewed planning version and material changes

For every new task, prepare readable, nonempty `prd.md` (requirements), `design.md` (solution), and `implement.md` (implementation and verification order). Keep each concise; the topics above are guidance, not required headings or word counts. Read all three together and resolve contradictions. File presence or a successful script cannot assess meaning or prove user identity.

Before first start or start after replanning:

1. Check the three files and decision-relevant research, then run `task.py attest <task-dir> --note "what was reviewed"`.
2. Run `task.py validate <task-dir>`. A waiting version may validate successfully but is still not approved.
3. Show the user the complete `reviewId`, explanation, and a plain-language summary of scope, solution, verification and limits. Append the summary, original three fingerprints, changes and real response/source to `<task-dir>/research/planning-review-log.md`; do not overwrite older rounds or invent message identifiers. Preserve the old review log before clearing records with replan; if saving fails, address that first. Full historical text requires version control; fingerprints cannot restore overwritten text.
4. Only after the user's explicit response to that version, recheck and run `task.py start <task-dir> --review <reviewId> --approval-note "actual response" --approval-source "locatable conversation source"`. Ordinary attest always creates a new version and clears prior approval; recomputing hashes cannot grant permission.

If requirements, design or the implementation plan materially change, including a change agreed in conversation, pause affected work and dispatched dependencies. Run `task.py replan <task-dir> --reason "what changed" --affected "work to pause" --independent "work that does not depend on the change, or none"`, update the three files and repeat review/confirmation. State why any continuing work is independent; that field does not grant new authorization. Keep normal coding, testing and fixes within the approved requirements moving. Record normal progress separately without checking off the frozen reviewed plan.

For a verified wording-only correction after start, use `task.py attest <task-dir> --editorial --note "specific correction; behavior and scope unchanged"`; preserve the reviewed version and confirmation. If the user has already responded but first start is not recorded, add `--editorial-note "specific correction"` to that same version-specific start. Inspect the actual diff; neither command can determine whether a purported wording correction changes meaning.

Only `in_progress`/`review` tasks with all three planning metadata keys absent may resume through the legacy path without backfilling the files. Partial, null or malformed records are not legacy. Completed tasks cannot start again. Same-task writes are serialized by the main session; concurrency and exactly-once hooks are not promised. Session hints query `task.py planning-status <task-dir> --json`; unavailable checks never imply permission to start. New records must match the current files on resume. Archive planning problems warn while existing archive checks remain in force.
